# Face2Finance - Mobile Financial Literacy Application

## Overview
Face2Finance is a mobile-first financial literacy onboarding application with complete authentication flow and biometric security options. The app provides a structured learning journey: landing page → walkthrough → login/signup with OTP → questionnaire → dashboard with educational modules.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript and JWT authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose ODM for persistent data storage
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with OTP email verification
- **Security**: Biometric authentication (fingerprint/Face ID) support via WebAuthn API

## User Preferences
- Mobile-only responsive design with smooth layout and mobile UX focus
- Remove mobile status icons (battery, internet) from top of screen
- Node.js and MongoDB for authentication (not in-memory storage)
